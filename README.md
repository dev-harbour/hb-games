## Text-based game development

Creating a text-based game in Harbour is a process that typically involves the following steps:

1. Designing the game: The first step in creating a text-based game is to design the game mechanics,
   story, and characters. This includes creating a detailed game map, outlining the main quest and any subplots,
   and deciding on the types of characters and enemies that will appear in the game.

2. Writing the game logic: Once the game design is complete, you can begin writing the code that will control the game logic.
   This includes creating functions to handle player input, update the game state, and display text on the screen.

3. Building the game world: With the game logic in place, you can start building the game world by creating locations,
   characters, items, and enemies. This is where you will use Harbour's database functionality to create and manipulate the game data.

4. Adding interaction: At this stage, you can add interactivity to the game by creating dialogues, puzzles, and other types of interactions
   that will make the game more engaging for the player. This step also includes user input handling, conditional statements and error management.

5. Testing and debugging: Once the game is complete, it's important to test it thoroughly and fix any bugs or issues that are discovered.
   This process involves running the game and playing through it, testing all aspects of the game mechanics, and fixing any errors or crashes that occur.

6. Release and maintenance: After all the steps are done, your game is ready to be distributed and shared. Ongoing maintenance will be necessary to fix
   any issue that might arise during the use of the game.

Creating a text-based game can be a fun and rewarding process, but it also requires a significant amount of planning and programming. With Harbour's
powerful set of libraries and functions, as well as its compatibility with existing xBase code, it can make the process of creating a text-based game
a bit easier.

Those are the general steps involved in creating a text-based game using the Harbour programming language, but there may be additional steps or
considerations depending on the specific requirements and complexity of the game you're trying to create. Some other things to keep in mind include:

- Improving the user interface, like adding a menu, color options, and other elements to improve the overall look and feel of the game.

- Adding sound effects and music to enhance the gaming experience.

- Adding a save feature, so players can save their progress and continue playing later on.

- Optimizing the performance of the game, in case the game is too slow or too resource intensive.

- Integrating different platforms, like a web or mobile versions of the game.

- Creating a public version of the game and providing support to end-users

Creating a text-based game is a challenging but very rewarding process. It requires a good deal of creativity and problem-solving skills.
The Harbour programming language offers a powerful set of libraries and functions that can help to make this process easier, but it's important
to keep in mind that game development takes time, effort and a lot of testing to get it right.
